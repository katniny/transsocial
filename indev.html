               <h1>TransSocial is still in development.</h1>
               <p style="color: var(--text-semi-transparent);">Created by <a href="/u/katniny">@katniny</a></p>

               <br />

               <p>Hey! Welcome to TransSocial! Firstly, thank you a bunch for being here. I'm <a href="/u/katniny">Katty</a>, the founder of TransSocial and the lead developer.</p>
               <p>As you noticed, we have a little notice that says that we're still in alpha. This is just because we're still working on a lot of TransSocial, and we're missing a lot of features or functionality that we're hoping to have. TransSocial is still stable and 100% usable!</p>

               <br />

               <h2>What's planned to be added?</h2>
               <p>I don't really have a "pre-defined" list of things I want to add before going into different stages of development.</p>
               <p>Basically this means, we go into a new stage of development when I think TransSocial is ready to.</p>
               <p>For example, TransSocial got completely rewritten before going into alpha.</p>

               <br />

               <h2>TransSocial's Plans for the Future</h2>
               <p>So what is TransSocial's (and my) plans for the future?</p>
               <p>It's super simple. Updates, updates, updates. I plan on updating TransSocial A LOT over the course of 2024/2025. I hope to get through these stages of development:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li style="color: var(--success-color);">InDev (Finished!)</li>
                  <li style="color: var(--success-color);">Pre-Alpha (Finished!)</li>
                  <li style="color: var(--warning-text);">Alpha (Current)</li>
                  <li>Beta</li>
                  <li>Pre-Release</li>
                  <li>Release</li>
               </ul>
               <p>(This list will be updated up until a little while after the release versions, when it will be removed).</p>
               <p>(Please note that this list does NOT mean that all these versions will be released in 2024/2025, I just hope they are!)</p>

               <br />

               <h2>What's going to release next update?</h2>
               <p>I wish I could tell you. TransSocial is always updating (seriously, anytime our GitHub is pushed to), so you can always visit the Updates page to learn more!</p>

               <br />

               <h2>What's new?</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="/updates">Check out the update log</a></li>
               </ul>

               <br />

               <p>Thank you so much for reading and have an amazing day,</p>
